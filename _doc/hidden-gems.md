## Hidden Gems

* partial VCS based undo: use `Rollback Lines`reverts only the changed chunk under the cursor to it's original state
* "code" completion (**CTRL+SPACE**) works also for paths (e.g. in the File open dialogue)
* smart filter all the things: "speed search" or what I would call "smart filtering" works pretty much in all areas, where you work with a list of items. Just start typing to filter the items wherever you have a hunch it should work. The only place where I wish it would work but doesn't is the classic context menu :)
* `Quick Definition` and `Quick Documentation` works pretty much everywhere - try it in code completion popups or in the `Project View` (also check out the other `Quick ...` actions, good stuff!)
* activate "change font size with CTRL+[Mouse Wheel] - it really should be on by default
* if your date format looks all wrong e.g. in commit view `Settings -> Date Format`: `YYYY-MM-dd` and use 24 hour time are objectively the only sane settings and should be the default anyway;)
* `Paste from History` **CTRL+SHIFT+V** -> inbuilt clipboard manager within PyCharm scope

### (Plugin) Keymap Exporter (Print Keymap)

[Keymap Exporter](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7066-keymap-exporter) generates a cheat sheet of your customized keyboard layout. But don't forget: if you haven't memorized a shortcut yet, you can use `Search Everywhere` to find the action and can see the shortcut right away. 

**Dear JetBrains:** Wouldn't it be better if `Help -> Keymap Reference` would do that, instead of always showing the default keymap?
